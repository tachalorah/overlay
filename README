This is my little Gentoo overlay. It (by now) provides these packages:
- app-i18n/ibus-bamboo: m17n isn't good enough on terminal, so.. yeah.
- net-libs/nodejs: ebuild modded to build without GCC. Building with GCC using
  this ebuild is not tested.
- sys-libs/musl: Chimera's patched version, with mimalloc in place of mallocng.
