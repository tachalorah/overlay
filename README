This is my little Gentoo overlay. It (by now) provides these packages:
- app-i18n/ibus-lotus: maintained fork of ibus-bamboo.
- games-emulation/nestopiarta: 108Pi's fork of Nestopia UE with frame counter
  and input display
- net-libs/nodejs: ebuild modded to build without GCC. Building with GCC using
  this ebuild is not tested.
- sys-libs/musl: Chimera's patched version, with mimalloc in place of mallocng.
